Here you have two choices, either A or B:

be qualified by the teacher.

The project requirements are:  
A user can:  
1. Log in, or create a new account  
2. Log out.  
3. Edit account information.  
4. Create posts.  
5. Comment posts.  
6. Delete posts.  
7. See other users and posts.

3. Edit user.  
4. delete user.

Technical Specs, the program must:  
- Be singlepage
- Use Localstorage
- Use Gravatars, not mandatory if you want to use something else for profile pictures.
- Use Geolocation (not mandatory)
- Adhere to the principles of YSLOW and high performing websites (do not minify code).

Groups:

The final project must be individual. This means that the student is responsible for every line of
code in the project, it is allowed to use code snippets from the web as long as the student can
explain them if asked at the exam.

Deliverables:  
1. A working program.

As I understood we are not allowed to use anything else than localstorage for storing data.
We are required to use Twitter bootstrap.

As of now I am using the following libraries, plugins and snippets:
